From coordinating and assembling our furniture deliveries, to managing our plumbing and electrical trades - there was no task he couldn’t handle. We even had a surprise leak that he fixed, leaving us with a worry-free mindset. We absolutely recommend Ed and will absolutely work with him for future maintenance of our space as he has always been reliable, trustworthy and efficient. ",
